# StaraKrc
Website for historical pictures and information from Prague-Krc written in PHP. This was the source code for http://krc-historie.cz/ from January 2016 to January 2019. It was replaced with new system written in Python Django. The development of this version was STOPPED.

This repository DOES contain all files including graphic elements and SQL database dump (version 2017-12-27).

However, this repository DOESN'T contain images included in the live website (/content/gallery folder). Also the dbconfig.dbc containing database connection properties is just a mock.

Possible future update - to clean the database and content files and leave only plain installation of the system...
